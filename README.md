Welcome to Our Test Automation Project!
This project showcases the power of Python and Selenium for automated testing. Leveraging the popular pytest framework, we've adopted a robust and efficient approach to testing.

Key Features:
DDT (Data-Driven Testing): Our tests are data-driven, allowing for versatile and comprehensive test coverage.
POM (Page Object Model): We've implemented the Page Object Model to organize and maintain our test framework, enhancing readability and scalability.
